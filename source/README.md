# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Table](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-3-section-ag/blob/main/source/Table.r) | A source file that creates a table of summary information to be included in your report.
|[Chart 1](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-3-section-ag/blob/main/source/Chart1_Homelessness_Trend.r) | A line graph that show the number of homeless between 2010 and 2020 so that you can visually see the fluctuations in the homelessness counts.
