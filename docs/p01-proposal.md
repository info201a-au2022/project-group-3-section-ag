## Abstract
Our main question is how does homelessness vary between states in America and why? This question is important because by analyzing the homelessness data between states, we can try to analyze a pattern between states with more homelessness vs less homelessness. If we are able to find some patterns, we can offer solutions or recommendations on how to hopefully reduce homelessness.

## Introduction

Shelter and housing is something that may seem basic. You probably are fortunate enough to have a roof over your head and a bed to go to at the end of the day. However, across America, there are over 500 thousand people who aren't as fortunate and aren't able to have a roof over their head or a bed to sleep in. This causes many problems and challenges not only for those that are homeless, but also those around them.
While you may think that someone being homeless is their own fault or their own choice, more often than not this isn't the case. There are many external reasons why someone may be facing homelessness including the lack of structural supports for those experiencing poverty, job loss that is out of their control, and inadequate help and discharge from people that are leaving hospitals, correctional, or mental health facilities.

## Problem Domain
Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. Note: You must include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure. (About 400 words.)

## Research Questions
How does homelessness vary between states in America and why?

Present your 3-5 research questions. You should present each research question. For each research question, you should discuss why it is important and what motivates the question. (About 50 words for each question, so for four questions you would write about 200 words or more if needed.)

## The Dataset
(1) Describe how your dataset is related to your problem domain and, specifically, to your research qeustions. That is, how will your dataset enable you to answer your research questions? (2) Include a table that presents the name of each data file, the number of observations (rows), and the number of variables (columns). (3) Include a full citation to each data file, including URL. (4) Finally, describe the provenance of your dataset, addressing such key questions as: (a) Who collected the data? When? For what purpose? (b) How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money? (c) How was the data validated and held secure? Is it credible and trustworthy? (d) How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data? (About 400 words.)

## Expected Implications
Homelessness is a big problem that impacts everyone. If we are able to address homelessness and find patterns that can explain why some areas have more homelessness than others, we can find solutions to these patterns to hopefully reduce homelessness as a whole. This can have implications on policymakers as they may have to enact new policies to clean up cities and enforce these solutions that more homelessness people can get the support they need. Technologists might be impacted as they might be able to create new technologies as solutions to the homelessness problem. Some states may have technology that allows them to better fight homelessness, and if they do, technologists will come into play to create more of these technologies for other areas.

Proposal only. Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (About 150 words.)

## Limitations
Proposal only. What limitations might you need to address? Briefly discuss. (About 150 words.)

## Acknowledgements
