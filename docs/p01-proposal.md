## Abstract
Our main question is how does homelessness vary between states in America and why? This question is important because by analyzing the homelessness data between states, we can try to analyze a pattern between states with more homelessness vs less homelessness. If we are able to find some patterns, we can offer solutions or recommendations on how to hopefully reduce homelessness.

## Introduction

Shelter and housing is something that may seem basic. You probably are fortunate enough to have a roof over your head and a bed to go to at the end of the day. However, across America, there are over half a million people who aren't as fortunate and aren't able to have a roof over their head or a bed to sleep in. This causes many problems and challenges not only for those that are homeless, but also those around them.
While you may think that someone being homeless is their own fault or their own choice, more often than not this isn't the case. There are many external reasons why someone may be facing homelessness including the lack of structural supports for those experiencing poverty, job loss that is out of their control, and inadequate help and discharge from people that are leaving hospitals, correctional, or mental health facilities.

## Problem Domain
* **Project Framing:** Working with homelessness data of America, we hope to bring attention to the issue that hundreds of thousands of Americans suffer from. We plan to use the data to highlight how homelessness affects each state and the response from each state to mitigate the issue. If time permits, including resources to assist homelessness may be a route to take so that the project extends the scope of research and becomes a resource to help homelessness. Seattle is already in the process of assisting the homeless in Seattle ([Addressing Homelessness](https://www.seattle.gov/human-services/reports-and-data/addressing-homelessness#:~:text=Who%20is%20experiencing%20homelessness%20in,compared%20to%20the%202019%20Count.)), but the project may be useful to areas across the nation where the city is not making any efforts.

* **Human Values:** Our motives for pursuing this topic centers around the values of community, justice, and power in a sense. As homelessness is an issue that results from a variety of factors for the given person, we wish to pinpoint how some of those factors contribute such as location and policies, a heavy emphasis is placed on policy per state in this Breakpoint article ([Homelessness in America: Why Many Solutions Fail](https://breakpoint.org/homelessness-in-america-why-many-solutions-fail/)). Our project is created with the motivation of a better community, all while maintaining a just perspective of the matter, and empowering those who lack the power and resources to sustain themselves.

* **Direct and Indirect Stakeholders:** Direct stakeholders of this project would include the homeless themselves as the data directly involves them and their information. Another direct stakeholder would be individuals accessing the data to benefit from the information within it. Indirect stakeholders would be the individuals accessing the data to browse the contents -- they have access, but the data does not benefit or harm them at all.

* **Harms:** Possible harms that may be produced from the project are unpredictable yet some can be assumed. Directing people's attention to the homelessness issue may lead to outcomes such as a decrease of homelessness in an area, but in exchange for the increase in another area. There's also the issue of properly reducing homelessness numbers leading to the overcrowding of long established residential areas and distrust in those communities. Our goal is not to encourage these harms, so we will be keeping them in mind while developing the project and making decisions.
* **Benefits:** The potential benefits of this project exceeds just directing peoples attentions to the situation, but it also includes directing peoples attentions to solutions that may lessen the homelessness volumes in the nation. If by chance the project successfully improves homelessness, then the communities of cities where homelessness persisted are able to improve and flourish. As Seattle residents claimed when hearing about Seattles homeless encampment cleanup, “I’m looking forward to it. It's like, quiet,” ([Seattle Homeless Encampment Near I-5 Cleared Through Gov. Inslee's Initiative](https://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-homeless-encampment-cleared-through-governor-inslees-initiative)).


## Research Questions
1. How does homelessness vary between states in America and why?
> Homelessness is something that occurs across the nation but understanding how it is distributed may provide value in understanding trends across the nation. Is geography a factor? Does the population of a city play a role? Discovering the distribution (likely in the form of a figure) will provide insight to answering these questions and more.

2. What factors may contribute to the volume of homelessness in a city?
> In addition to the first question, this question dives deeper and focuses on the factors present within each state or city. Perhaps the cost of living in one city is more than another, or maybe drug abuse is a bigger issue in one area than another, or even just the amount of jobs available to the area isn’t good enough. There are many factors that affect homelessness, but our project strives to find the factors that have the most effect on the matter.

3. In Seattle, how has the homelessness issue changed over the years? Have services offered over the years led to a change in the numbers?
> We see homelessness on the streets of Seattle since we live/learn in the area, but how has this changed over time? Using a dataset describing the status of homelessness through 1998-2020, we want to analyze it to understand the trends over different spans of time that affected homelessness. Through understanding, we can find what efforts may be more effective and which methods may be ineffective.


## The Dataset
|Data file name | Purpose|number of observations|number of variables|citation|
|-----| -----------------| ----------|------------|-----------|
|[homelessness_2020.csv](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-3-section-ag/blob/main/data/homelessness_2020.csv) | A data set that has homelessness counts for 2020 in each state to give us data on the number of homeless. | 58 | 541 | Pit and HIC Data since 2007.” HUD Exchange, https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/
|[homelessness_change.csv](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-3-section-ag/blob/main/data/homelessness_change.csv) | A data set that has the percent change in homelessness since 2020 so we can calculate the homeless counts for previous years. | 58 | 14 | “Pit and HIC Data since 2007.” HUD Exchange, https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/.
|[DHS_Daily_Report.csv](https://github.com/info201a-au2022/project-group-3-section-ag/blob/main/data/DHS_Daily_Report.csv) | A data set that has details about number of people in homeless shelters to find out the ratio of those that are homeless but still getting help with shelters. | 3306 | 13 | https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dhs-daily-report

These data sets are important for our research questions as they will be able to tell us the distribution of homelessness in the states. For example, the first data set has the homelessness counts for each state which will explicitly tell us the differing homelessness counts in each state. The second and third questions will be answered not explicitly through the datasets, but by looking at the data and doing extra external research, we can come to conclusions that can help us answer the questions.

## Expected Implications
Homelessness is a big problem that impacts everyone. If we are able to address homelessness and find patterns that can explain why some areas have more homelessness than others, we can find solutions to these patterns to hopefully reduce homelessness as a whole. This can have implications on policymakers as they may have to enact new policies to clean up cities and enforce these solutions that more homelessness people can get the support they need. Technologists might be impacted as they might be able to create new technologies as solutions to the homelessness problem. Some states may have technology that allows them to better fight homelessness, and if they do, technologists will come into play to create more of these technologies for other areas. Designers may be implicated as they may be needed to develop and design areas that are visually appealing, safe, and welcoming to those that are homeless. A lot of resources that are available to homeless don't seem very safe or welcoming which discourages the homeless to get help. If there are designers that can make these places look better, the homeless might be more likely to seek help at these locations.

## Limitations
Some limitations that we might need to address is that not all of the homeless are accounted for. While I don't think we should adjust the numbers that we collect as data, it is just something to consider that there are probably more homeless than what is accounted for. Another limitation is that we aren't homeless so we have some **privilege hazard** and can't fully grasp the challenges that people that are homeless face. As a result, some of our research and solutions may be skewed a little bit since we do have that privilege hazard.
